FOLDER / FILE DESCRIPTION

SHARED SERVICES Folder
- Constants: List of various constants used in methods, so all the Udacity and Parse API constants are in one place
- GlobalVars - global variables
- NetworkServices: network-oriented methods. Note that I tried to learn the "GUARD" philosophy - you'll see them a lot
